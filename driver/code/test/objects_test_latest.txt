Result: Speed = 0, Speed Limit = 40

--- Testing Green Traffic Light (green_light.jpg) ---
Result: Speed = 40, Speed Limit = 40

--- Testing Person (person.jpg) ---
Result: Speed = 0, Speed Limit = 40

--- Testing Stop Sign (stop_sign.jpg) ---
Result: Speed = 0, Speed Limit = 40

--- Testing Speed Limit 25 (limit_25.jpg) ---
Result: Speed = 25, Speed Limit = 25

--- Testing Speed Limit 40 (limit_40.jpg) ---
Result: Speed = 40, Speed Limit = 40

--- Testing No Object (no_obj.jpg) ---
Result: Speed = 40, Speed Limit = 40

=== Testing Stop Sign Sequence ===
1. First stop sign detection:
2. Second detection (still waiting):
3. Wait 2 seconds...
4. After wait period - should resume:
